# DOTFILES

Eternal WIP since I'm a noob and I'm always playing around with everything

Things needed to have a good working setup:
- git and bashrc config to have the branch on prompt
- nvm and install node --lts `nvm install --lts && nvm use --lts --default`
- neovim 0.5
- C compiler for treesitter, in ubuntu gcc and build-essential perhaps ? `sudo apt-get update --fix-missing && sudo apt-get install gcc build-essential`
- vim plugged
- symbolic link of gitconfig on home folder `ln -s [file] [destination]`
- scala -> coursier and make coursier work for you

PERHAP GOOD IDEAS:
- Zshell or fish ? take a look at them they look fun
